            Played with dates. Need to figure out how to represent/calculate habit completion dates.
            
07/21:14:   Played with dates more. Getting a firmer grasp.
            Rearranged methods to make things more clear.
            Change Habit.creationDate to Habit.lastCompletion
            
07/24/14:   Learned how to sort arrays.
            Added a UIView to hold each habit's label, button, etc.
            Easier to add and remove elements in the future.
            Started using git!
            habitLabels now sort by lastCompletionDate
            Trying to work out how to figure out when to show/hide labels. my brain hurts.
            
07/27/14:   Figured out how to know when to show/hide labels. It wasn't really that hard.
            Need to learn how to work with completion dates of newly created habits
            
07/28/14:   Added a starting date (01-Jan-1900) for newly created habits.
            Checks if a habit with the same name already exists before creating.
            Strips whitespace from the start and end of new habit names.
            Playing with adding in a pull-to-refresh
            Combined removeAllHabits and displayAllHabits into a single refreshHabits method

08/03/14:   Added pull-to-refresh
            Playing with dates. Time zones are weird!
            
08/04/14:   Turns out time zones weren't causing problems. Still, dates are hard.
            Labels now display days since habit was last completed
            Added an edit button to the nav bar
            When pressed, switches to a view that allows deletion of habits

09/23/14:   Playing with the new UIAlertController but I'm too tired so I gave up pretty quickly

09/24/14:   Figured out UIAlertControllers
            Moved the actual alerts to the NewHabitViewController
            This means that it will stay on the create-a-habit view when you get a creation error

09/29/14:   Changed all the alerts to UIAlertControllers
            Added an action sheet to confirm deletion
            Creation of a habit now check's the length of the name and rejects creation if the name couldn't be displayed

09/30/14:   Added the settings view and the button to move to it
            did some minor refactoring

10/02/14:   Moved some methods to a utility class
            Created a couple views on the settings view for testing

10/03/14:   Got the time picker viewable, and it updates and stuff
            Started working on animating it

10/03/14:   time picker animates nicely now

01/24/15:   been a while!!
            Started making the mainViewController a UITableView instead of a ScrollView
            It just makes sense

01/25/15:   added some of the old visuals: done button, buffer space, last completed labels
            just started working on edit mode

01/31/15:   created a subclass for custom cells for the habit table
            working on the transition between editing mode

02/01/15:   got the done button working
            edit mode shows all the habits / normal mode shows the correct habits
            the animation into edit mode works ok

02/07/15:   the done button animates more nicely when it's disappearing
            the deletion animation is weird and I don't know what that's about

02/09/15:   added animations for the transition to/from edit mode
            still don't know why the deletion animation is borked
            posted a question on stackoverflow but got no answers

02/12/15:   added the old style delete button to avoid the weird animation issues
            the app is basically back to where I left it off in october, except rebuilt with tableview
            easier to work with, and animations!
            Also fixed alignment issues on the settingsView and newHabitView

03/01/15:   made habitsToView an array of just keys for habits, instead of an array of habits

05/20/15:   added a class for sqlite3 usage.. and it works!!

06/10/15:   implemented a schema in the db for habits
            changed the habit data saving over to the database
            now the old data file only saves the refresh time
            TODO: app crashes when closed on a view that isn't the main view because it tries to save
               refresh time to the file, but that only exists on the main view

06/14/15:   changed the color scheme to something more pleasing... maybe???
            fixed all views so that they mutate correctly when the screen rotates
            correctly...knock on wood

06/15/15:   ...I did a few small things, and then I got caught up switching everything to autolayout with contraints
            so much easier!
            I've finished all views except the settingsView

06/15/15:   finished converting everything to autolayout & contraints
            finished TODO:  app crashes when closed on a view that isn't the main view because it tries to save
                            refresh time to the file, but that only exists on the main view

07/06/15:   added launchImages so that the app scales correctly on iphone 6/6+

07/09/15:   removed fullHeight and fullWidth from utils
            moved all the colors from utils to a separate colors class, and made them constants instead of methods
            renamed utils class to DateUtils since only date methods were left
            finished TODO:  the timepicker keeps rolling after it hides, causing errors. fix it
            added unit tests for DateUtils and Habit

07/10/15:   added unit tests for HabitCell
            started unit tests for HabitDB

07/11/15:   CHANGED HABIT.DB TO HABIT_TESTS.DB
            BECAUSE I'M TOO LAZY TO FIGURE OUT A GOOD WAY TO MAKE IT DIFFERENT DURING TESTS
            DO NOT FORGET TO CHANGE THIS BACK!!!

07/12/15:   Finished tests for HabitDB class
            Started tests for the new habit view controller
            need to work on constraints, and the actual create method

07/14/15:   made tests for contraints for newhabitviewcontroller
            need to learn mocks?? I guess to test alert popups

07/19/15:   added OCMock to project
            learned the basics of mocking
            added tests for createHabit in NewHabitViewController
            added a new "test" configuration so I can use a different db for testing vs. debugging
            stayed up too late doing this :(

07/26/15:   removed a superfluous uiview in SettingsViewController
            started tests for SettingsViewController
            next up: constraints :(

08/02/15:   finished tests for SettingsViewController
            started tests for MainViewController
            constraints are weird for MainViewController

08/03/15:   worked on tests for MainViewController

09/08/15:   changed completion date data to NOT have hours/minutes
            this paves the way for streak data to make sense

            ^^^ this ruins everything. don't know what I was thinking. rolled back these changes

09/14/15:   added a check to validate the database. this should prevent crashes like when zain updated to a new version
            added 'streak' to Habits
            changed the labels to display streak at appropriate times
            began adding a message bar to give the user a bit of information

09/14/15:   continued working on message bar / got the functionality there, need to work on the look

09/18/15:   must have changed the look at some point in the last few days: looks pretty good past charlie!
            fixed a few bugs for iOS 9

09/20/15:   more fixes for iOS 9
            added a launch screen storyboard because that's required now apparently

09/26/15:   modified the launch screen storyboard

11/22/15:   implemented a daily reminder notification


TODO:   add unit tests for everything else
TODO:   change name of NewHabitViewController to HabitViewController

Future feature ideas:

    - streak data (i.e., how many days in a row has a habit been completed)
    - calendar view
    - unit tests
    - different repeat lengths (do a habit once a day, week, month, etc)
    - editable habits
    - social add-ins ('share your habit streak on facebook!')
