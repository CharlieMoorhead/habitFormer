            Played with dates. Need to figure out how to represent/calculate habit completion dates.
            
7/21:14:    Played with dates more. Getting a firmer grasp.
            Rearranged methods to make things more clear.
            Change Habit.creationDate to Habit.lastCompletion
            
7/24/14:    Learned how to sort arrays.
            Added a UIView to hold each habit's label, button, etc.
                Easier to add and remove elements in the future.
            Started using git!
            
            habitLabels now sort by lastCompletionDate
            Trying to work out how to figure out when to show/hide labels. my brain hurts.
            
7/27/14:    Figured out how to know when to show/hide labels. It wasn't really that hard.
            Need to learn how to work with completion dates of newly created habits
            
7/28/14:    Added a starting date (01-Jan-1900) for newly created habits.
            Checks if a habit with the same name already exists before creating.
            Strips whitespace from the start and end of new habit names.
            
            Playing with adding in a pull-to-refresh
            Combined removeAllHabits and displayAllHabits into a single refreshHabits method

8/3/14:     Added pull-to-refresh
            Playing with dates. Time zones are weird!
