            Played with dates. Need to figure out how to represent/calculate habit completion dates.
            
7/21:14:    Played with dates more. Getting a firmer grasp.
            Rearranged methods to make things more clear.
            Change Habit.creationDate to Habit.lastCompletion
            
7/24/14:    Learned how to sort arrays.
            Added a UIView to hold each habit's label, button, etc.
                Easier to add and remove elements in the future.
            Started using git!
            
            habitLabels now sort by lastCompletionDate
            Trying to work out how to figure out when to show/hide labels. my brain hurts.
            
7/27/14:    Figured out how to know when to show/hide labels. It wasn't really that hard.
            Need to how to work with completion dates of newly created habits
